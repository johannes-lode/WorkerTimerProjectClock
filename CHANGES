    (else data loss may occur)
  - default project for startup is selectable
  - some more reports from menu available

IMPORTANT!!!!

projclock.tcl
	- having left a timer running overnight (again) I implemented an
	  "end-of-day" watchdog, which gives you 5 minutes to continue or
	  have the current timer stopped automatically.
	- added hooks for a ~/.pclockrc file (config tools coming later)

wrappers
	- created one for summary, to avoid the missing included files
	- changed the name from pclock to pck-timer, summary to pck-summary
	- make install now installs these; make "oinstall" installs using the
	  old names

projclock.tcl
