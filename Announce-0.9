This is release 0.9 of WorkerTimer (formerly Project Clock), and is a maintenance release.
Thanks to Gerald Lester and Michael Fullertone for raising some issues.

Most popups now transient.
Custom summary now works if the PCLOCK_HOME directory has spaces in its name.
New '-T' option to summarise hours rather than days + hours.
