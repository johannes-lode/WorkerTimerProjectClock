Installing Project Clock
------------------------

YOU NEED TCL/TK to run Project Clock! I recommend at least version 8.2.

You will need Extended Tcl's 'wishx' if you want SIGINT caught. 
Otherwise you will have to change 'wishx' to 'wish' in the pck-timer shell script.
Pclock will run without change in either case.

Project Clock is made up of three Tcl scripts. The main stuff is
'projclock.tcl' which sources 'utilproc.tcl' and 'tips.tcl' from the same directory.

Linux/Unix users:
-----------------

To install in the standard places (/usr/local/....), just type 'make install'.

To install elsewhere:

	make PREFIX=<common-prefix> install

where "common-prefix" is e.g. /usr/local, /opt ...

	make PROGDIR=<run-dir> LIBDIR=<place for tcl files> DOCDIR=<place for docs> install

If you don't have wishx, add WISH=wish to the above lines.

The application name as used by window managers (for icons, etc)
is 'pclock.tcl'.

Win32 users:
------------

Unpack the gzip file using WinZip into any suitable folder.

Since win32 doesn't do wrapper scripts very well, you'll have to rely on the file 
association between .tcl and 'wish'.

A double-click on (folder)\projclock.tcl should fire it up.
You may have to make (folder) the current directory first.
